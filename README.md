# echo_bug

This code is made to run on a Raspberry Pi Zero W or any Linux-based device with Bluetooth. Its goal is to detect Bluetooth devices and send them to the [Echo server](https://github.com/a2br/echo-mum). It has multiple use cases : for example, it could enable you to estimate how many people are in a room.
